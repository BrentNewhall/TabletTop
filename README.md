TabletTop
=========

TabletTop is intended to be a tablet/phone-based tabletop RPG system. Users will play a traditional tabletop RPG game, while the numbers are crunched on phones and tablets.

This is where we're collaborating on the software.

Someone suggested Phonegap as a cross-platform development tool. It's a possibility.
